    "description":"Discharges of untreated wastewater from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) can affect hydraulic stress and have significant  environmental impacts on receiving water bodies. Common flow rate and water level sensors for monitoring of CSO events are expensive in terms of investment costs, installation, operation and maintenance. This paper presents a novel surrogate method to detect CSO events by using two low-cost temperature sensors. The novelty is the experimental setup for installation of temperature sensors in CSO structures and an algorithm developed to automatically calculate the duration of CSO events considering the response time of the system. The occurrence and duration of CSO events is computed based on the convergence of the two temperature signals. The method was tested under field conditions in a CSO structure, and the results were compared to the information gathered from a parallel installed flow sensor. The application of two temperature sensors installed inside a CSO structure was proven to be robust and accurate for the automatic detection of the occurrence and duration of CSO events. Within the 7-month test phase, 100% of the 20 CSO events could be detected without false detections. The accuracy of detecting the start and end of the CSO events was 2 min in comparison to the flow sensor.",

The game is a participatory urban planning process where twelve different ECS can be implemented by the players as long as they respect the normative and do not exceed their budgets. The available ECS combine different aims (communitarian or professional), technologies (soil-based or hydroponic), different locations (on the ground or rooftop) and different yields (vegetables or fruit trees). To explore the impact of these twelve ECS, 8 indicators are calculated: heat island effect; water management; green accessibility; public participation; green economy; food sovereignty; green justice. Competing with the implementation of ECS, the players can also construct social housing to avoid gentrification and install solar panels to increase the production of renewable energies in the city. The players can choose among eight different characters to play with, each character corresponds to a specific stakeholder with different interests in the city: municipality; neighbours\u2019 association; SME organization; educational sector; consumers\u2019 cooperative; social sector; conservationist NGO and tourism promotion agency. During the game, the players interact among them by buying and selling plots, granting permissions, or requesting subsidies.",

The user can view supplementary information about the technology, such as the number of people served per unit, water throughput, lifetime, safe water storage capacity, standalone technology, water source, availability on the local market, CAPEX and cost per m3, size and weight. A bar plot is displayed with the performance of the technology against the following intrinsic criteria: WHO performance target, maintenance, instantaneous water supply, power requirements, easiness of use, taste alteration, waste generation.",

Worldwide the most common management is incineration and landfill disposal (by far).

These WWTPs have been selected according to the criteria of population served (\u224880% of the population of Catalonia is served by these 56 WWTPs) and territorial balance (at least one WWTP per region, with the exception of Moianès). The WWTPs collect flow-based composite integrated samples that are sent to 3 specialized laboratories where the analysis of the genetic material of the SARS-Cov-2 is carried out; the results are published in this web viewer after verifying the quality and integrity of the whole process. The map viewer has been developed by EURECAT in collaboration with ICRA. ICRA has programmed the backend and web-forms that wastewater treatment plants and the labs have to fill to generate the data. The map viewer uses the data from the forms. ICRA has worked on the design of the web viewer also. The results are updated weekly.",

    "description":"The WATExR project aims to deliver a series of environmental and ecological seasonal forecasting tools to the water sector. The tools will employ a variety of under-the-hood lake, catchment and fish phenology models to provide stakeholders (e.g., reservoir managers/educators/fish stock assessors) with predictions of aquatic phenomena at a seasonal time-scale. Using the tools, stakeholders will have access to probabilistic aquatic forecasts driven by state-of-the-art seasonal climate projections. The tools will update monthly and provide an indication of the expected average environmental conditions during the impending 3 to 9 months relative to the average conditions experienced during the most recent climate period. In so doing, the water sector will join the growing list of environmental sectors for which seasonal climate forecasts are showing strong potential to inform management.\n \nThe WATExR project (watexr.eu) offers tools to connect the available climatic forecasting/prediction systems on global spatial scales to impact variables in lakes and reservoirs on local or regional scales. However, this is not a trivial task, mainly because of the nature of the climatic data which required an uncertainty analysis (probabilistic approach) and the complex preprocessing and postprocessing needed to apply climatic global data to real problems in local or regional scales. All together, limits the understanding and applicability to expert users. Our project comes up with a solution to build the bridge needed between climatic forecast/predictions and day-to-day water quality problems.  \n",

    "shortDescription":"Model to describe spatial variation of wastewater-based contaminants in Europe",
    "description":"wOtter is an open-source, rapid and user-friendly model that may be used to predict wastewater contamination in river networks of Europe. A full simulation of the model requires 25 seconds, although this number may be brought down using a different simulation method.  wOtter processes data on sanitation, on rivers and on lakes. In the wastewater part, the data is transformed such that a data frame (excel file) is obtained, which contains the information on the size of the discharge (in person equivalents), the treatment and the point of entry to the river. In the part on rivers, a shapefile of rivers is converted to a graph object, which contains information on the river flow directions, the discharge and residence times. In case a section of a river is identified as a lake, the residence time for the nodes in the graph are replaced by a residence time calculation specifically for lakes. When the data on wastewater, rivers and lakes is processed, the model may be implemented by entering the contamination from discharges and propagating it through the river network, taking into account attenuation.\nThe information on the river network in Europe comes from the HydroSHEDS database. This database uses the waterGAP model and satellite imagery to derive discharges of rivers. The river locations and discharges were taken at a resolution of 15 arc seconds. The data on contamination in Europe originates from two sources. The first source is the UWWTD database which contains information on treatment plants in Europe. For a particular treatment plant, it gives the load in person equivalents and it gives the treatment type at the plant. The database is supplemented with the WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) database, which gives nationwide statistics on wastewater treatment or lack thereof. This allows for the inclusion of non-treatment plant wastewater sources, as well as for a correction of the treated person equivalents reported in the UWWTD database. The data used for the calibration and validation of the model come from Wilkinson et. al. (2022). This paper contained information on 61 pharmaceuticals in 1052 sampling sites. Of those 1052 sampling sites, 320 fell within the scope of our study. ",
