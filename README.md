# itlab (https://itlab.icra.cat)
ICRA's ITLAB is a catalog of the main IT solutions developed in research and/or
innovation projects with ICRA participation. It provides a description of each
of project and gives credit to the researchers and computer engineers involved.
It allows accessing the solutions and, in some cases, the source code. The
ITLAB has been promoted by Dr. Lluís Corominas and Prof. Joaquim Comas and it
is maintained by the team of computer engineers involved in the development of
the IT solutions (Lluís Bosch, Adrià Riu, Josep Pueyo & Joan Saló).
