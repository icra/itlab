  About licenses
</h1>

<p>
  Adding licenses to the apps and tools created within the activity of
  ICRA research is an important consideration to ensure that the
  software can be shared, used, and modified by others in compliance
  with legal requirements. Here are some guidelines that you could
  consider when deciding on the license to use:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Identify the goals and values of ICRA: Consider the mission and goals of
    your research center and the values that the software should reflect.
    Choose a license that aligns with the values of the research center, such
    as promoting collaboration, sharing, and innovation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider the impact of the license on future research: Choose a license
    that enables the sharing and reuse of the software by others, including
    other researchers and developers. This can foster collaboration,
    accelerate research, and promote the use of the software in new
    applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Decide between open-source or proprietary licenses: Open-source licenses
    provide more flexibility for sharing and modifying the software, while
    proprietary licenses can offer more control over the use and distribution
    of the software. Choose a license that best aligns with the research
    center's goals and values.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider the type of license: There are several types of open-source
    licenses, including permissive licenses (e.g., MIT, BSD) and copyleft
    licenses (e.g., GPL, AGPL). Permissive licenses allow for more freedom in
    using and modifying the software, while copyleft licenses require
    derivative works to be released under the same license. Choose a license
    that aligns with the goals and values of the research center.
  </li>
  <li>
    Seek legal advice: Consult with legal counsel to ensure that the chosen
    license is legally valid and enforceable. This can help to mitigate the
    risk of legal disputes and ensure that the software is compliant with
    relevant laws and regulations.
  </li>
</ol>
